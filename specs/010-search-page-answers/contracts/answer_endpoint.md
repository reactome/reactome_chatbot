# Contract: the search-page answer endpoint

What this repo commits to providing, and what the website repo can build against.
Shapes are proposals until both sides agree; the *properties* below are the parts
worth arguing about.

## Request

```
POST /chat/api/answer
Content-Type: application/json

{ "question": "what does CDK5 phosphorylate in Alzheimer disease?",
  "human_token": "<evidence the caller verified a person>" }
```

`human_token` is D1 and **not yet decided** -- a signed cookie on the shared parent
domain, a short-lived minted token, or a server-side vouch. This repo verifies
evidence; it does not perform the check.

## Response: Server-Sent Events

Streaming rather than a single JSON body, because the whole answer currently takes
25-32s and a search page cannot wait. Streaming turns that into "something appears in
about two seconds".

```
event: start
data: {"release": 97, "answered": true}

event: token
data: {"text": "CDK5, when bound to p25, phosphorylates "}

event: citation
data: {"st_id": "R-HSA-8862803", "display_name": "Deregulated CDK5 triggers..."}

event: done
data: {"state": "answered", "seconds": 8.4}
```

`state` is one of `answered`, `nothing_found`, `refused`, `failed`.

### Why citations are separate events

So the website renders links in its own style. Returning prose with embedded HTML
anchors -- what the chat UI does today -- would force the search page to parse them
back out and re-style them. Stable IDs resolve at
`reactome.org/content/detail/<st_id>`.

## Properties worth holding to

**It must be safe to ignore.** Any failure, timeout, refusal or unverified caller
produces a `done` with a non-`answered` state. The website renders no panel. The
search page must never be slower or broken because this service is down (FR-006,
SC-004).

**No answer without a token.** Refused before any model call, not after (FR-003).
Search pages get crawled, and every crawled search reaching the model is a bill.

**Not every search gets a panel.** The caller may ask for every query; this service
decides, and may answer `nothing_found` because the question is navigational rather
than answerable (D2, User Story 3).

**The answer is tied to a release.** `start` carries it so a cached answer can be
invalidated after a release (FR-007).

**One brain.** The endpoint and the chat UI share a graph. If they can disagree about
the same question, that is a defect.

## Budget

| | target | today |
|---|---|---|
| first token | 2s | n/a -- no streaming endpoint exists |
| complete | 10s | **25.4s and 32.2s** measured 2026-09-17 |

Retrieval is 14.9s of that, which is why
[spec 009](../../009-collection-routing/spec.md) is on this feature's critical path
rather than a parallel nicety.

## What the website side needs to decide

1. How a verified person is represented (D1) -- the security boundary
2. Whether it calls this service directly from the browser, or proxies server-side.
   Proxying makes the token question easier and keeps this service off the public
   internet
3. What it renders for each `state`, particularly `nothing_found` -- probably nothing
4. Whether repeat searches are cached at its layer or this one (D3)
