TP53 binds the PTEN promoter,PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome 10) is a tumor suppressor gene that is deleted or mutated in a variety of human cancers. TP53 (p53) binds to the p53-binding site at the PTEN promoter level (Stambolic et al. 2001).
"PTEN gene transcription is stimulated by TP53, EGR1, PPARG, ATF2, MAF1, and inhibited by NR2E1, SALL4, MECOM, SNAI1, SNAI2, JUN","PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome 10) is a tumor suppressor gene that is deleted or mutated in a variety of human cancers. TP53 (p53) stimulates PTEN transcription (Stambolic et al. 2000, Singh et al. 2002). PTEN, acting as a negative regulator of PI3K/AKT signaling, affects cell survival, cell cycling, proliferation and migration. PTEN regulates TP53 stability by inhibiting AKT-mediated activation of TP53 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, and thus enhances TP53 transcriptional activity and its own transcriptional activation by TP53. Beside their cross-regulation, PTEN and TP53 can interact and cooperate to regulate survival or apoptotic phenomena (Stambolic et al. 2000, Singh et al. 2002, Nakanishi et al. 2014).<br>In response to UV induced DNA damage, PTEN transcription is stimulated by binding of the transcription factor EGR1 to the promoter region of PTEN (Virolle et al. 2001).<br>PTEN transcription is also stimulated by binding of the activated nuclear receptor PPARG (PPARgamma) to peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) in the promoter of the PTEN gene (Patel et al. 2001), binding of the ATF2 transcription factor, activated by stress kinases of the p38 MAPK family, to ATF response elements in the PTEN gene promoter (Shen et al. 2006) and by the transcription factor MAF1 (Li et al. 2016).<br>NR2E1 (TLX) associated with transcription repressors binds the evolutionarily conserved TLX consensus site in the PTEN promoter. NR2E1 inhibits PTEN transcription by associating with various transcriptional repressors, probably in a cell type or tissue specific manner. PTEN transcription is inhibited when NR2E1 forms a complex with ATN1 (atrophin-1) (Zhang et al. 2006, Yokoyama et al. 2008), KDM1A (LSD1) histone methyltransferase containing CoREST complex (Yokoyama et al. 2008), or histone deacetylases HDAC3, HDAC5 or HDAC7 (Sun et al. 2007).<br>Binding of the transcriptional repressor SNAI1 (Snail1) to the PTEN promoter represses PTEN transcription. SNAI1-mediated repression of PTEN transcription may require phosphorylation of SNAI1 on serine residue S246. Binding of SNAI1 to the PTEN promoter increases in response to ionizing radiation and is implicated in SNAI1-mediated resistance to gamma-radiation induced apoptosis (Escriva et al. 2008). Binding of another Slug/Snail family member SNAI2 (SLUG) to the PTEN gene promoter also represses PTEN transcription (Uygur et al. 2015).<br>Binding of JUN to the AP-1 element in the PTEN gene promoter (Hettinger et al. 2007) inhibits PTEN transcription. JUN partner FOS is not needed for JUN-mediated downregulation of PTEN (Vasudevan et al. 2007).<br>Binding of the transcription factor SALL4 to the PTEN gene promoter (Yang et al. 2008) and SALL4-medaited recruitment of the transcriptional repressor complex NuRD (Lu et al. 2009, Gao et al. 2013), containing histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, inhibits the PTEN gene transcription. SALL4-mediated recruitment of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) is also implicated in transcriptional repression of PTEN (Yang et al. 2012).<br>Binding of the transcription factor MECOM (EVI1) to the PTEN gene promoter and MECOM-mediated recruitment of polycomb repressor complexes containing BMI1 (supposedly PRC1.4), and EZH2 (PRC2) leads to repression of PTEN transcription (Song et al. 2009, Yoshimi et al. 2011)."
TP53 family members bind PPP1R13B or TP53BP2,"TP53 (p53) forms a complex with PPP1R13B (ASPP1) or TP53BP2 (ASPP2). This interaction involves the DNA binding domain of TP53 and the C-terminus of ASSP proteins (Samuels-Lev et al. 2001, Patel et al. 2008). ASPP proteins can also form a complex with p53 family members TP63 (p63) and TP73 (p73) (Robinson et al. 2008, Patel et al. 2008). ASPP proteins enhance the binding of p53 family members to promoters of pro-apoptotic genes and promote their transcription, but do not affect the transcription of cell cycle regulators. ASPP proteins are frequently down-regulated in breast cancers that express wild-type TP53 (Samuels-Lev et al. 2001, Bergamaschi et al. 2004). "
p53-Dependent G1/S DNA damage checkpoint,"The arrest at G1/S checkpoint is mediated by the action of a widely known tumor suppressor protein, p53.  Loss of p53 functions, as a result of mutations in cancer prevent the G1/S checkpoint (Kuerbitz et al, 1992).  P53 is rapidly induced in response to damaged DNA.  A number of kinases, phosphatases, histone acetylases and ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes regulate the stability as well as transcriptional activity of p53 after DNA damage."
TP53 or TP63 binds the GSDME gene,"Gasdermin E (GSDME, also known as DFNA5) was identified as a direct target gene of the transcription factor p53 (Masuda Y et al. 2006). Increased expression of GSDME in a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2) treated with H2O2, UV (30 J/m2) or gamma rays (50 Gy) was p53‑dependent. A chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay using HepG2 identified a potential p53‑binding site in intron 1 of the GSDME gene. A luciferase reporter gene assay using human non‑small cell lung carcinoma H1299 cells further confirmed that the site is the p53‑responsive sequence involved in the recruitment of TP53 (p53) to the GSDME gene. In addition, P63γ and p73β also upregulated GSDME in human breast cancer MCF7 cells treated with demethylating agent 5‑aza‑2'‑deoxycytidine (DAC), suggesting that the GSDME expression can be regulated by multiple members of the p53 family (Fujikane T et al. 2010)."
"GSDME expression mediated by TP53, TP63","Gasdermin E (GSDME, also known as DFNA5) was identified as a direct target gene of the transcription factor p53 (Masuda Y et al. 2006). Increased expression of GSDME in a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2) treated with H2O2, UV (30 J/m2) or gamma rays (50 Gy) was p53‑dependent. TP53 (p53) induced GSDME expression via a specific p53 binding site in intron 1 of the GSDME gene (Masuda Y et al. 2006). In addition, P63γ and p73β also upregulated GSDME in demethylating agent 5‑aza‑2'‑deoxycytidine (DAC)‑treated human breast cancer MCF7 cells, suggesting that the GSDME expression can be regulated by multiple members of the p53 family (Fujikane T et al. 2010)."
p53 positively regulates transcription of MIR34 microRNAs,"Transcription of microRNA MIR34A is directly induced by the tumor suppressor p53, which binds to the conserved p53 binding site located in the vicinity of the MIR34A transcription start (Chang et al. 2007, Raver-Shapira et al. 2007). Genomic loss of the chromosomal band 1p36, harboring the MIR34A gene, is a frequent event in pancreatic cancer, and MIR34A is considered to act as a tumor suppressor. Conserved p53 binding sites were also mapped to the promoter of clustered MIR34B and MIR34C genes, and the transcription of MIR34B and MIR34C microRNAs was shown to be positively regulated by p53 (He et al. 2007, Corney et al. 2007). The steps involved in processing of pri-microRNA into pre-microRNA have been omitted in this event - please refer to the diagram of Regulatory RNA Pathways for details."
TP53 stimulates PLAGL1 expression,Binding of TP53 (p53) to the p53 response element in the promoter of the PLAGL1 (ZAC1) gene stimulates PLAGL1 transcription (Rozenfeld-Granot et al. 2002). PLAGL1 is a zinc finger protein implicated in transcriptional regulation. PLAGL1 expression correlates with both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Spengler et al. 1997) and is frequently lost in cancer (Varrault et al. 1998). The mechanism of PLAGL1 action requires further elucidation. 
TP53 regulates transcription of additional cell cycle genes whose exact role in the p53 pathway remain uncertain,"BTG2 is induced by TP53, leading to cessation of cellular proliferation (Rouault et al. 1996, Duriez et al. 2002). BTG2 binds to the CCR4-NOT complex and promotes mRNA deadenylation activity of this complex. Interaction between BTG2 and CCR4-NOT is needed for the antiproliferative activity of BTG2, but the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated (Rouault et al. 1998, Mauxion et al. 2008, Horiuchi et al. 2009, Doidge et al. 2012, Ezzeddine et al. 2012). Two polo-like kinases, PLK2 and PLK3, are direct transcriptional targets of TP53. TP53-mediated induction of PLK2 may be important for prevention of mitotic catastrophe after spindle damage (Burns et al. 2003). PLK2 is involved in the regulation of centrosome duplication through phosphorylation of centrosome-related proteins CENPJ (Chang et al. 2010) and NPM1 (Krause and Hoffmann 2010). PLK2 is frequently transcriptionally silenced through promoter methylation in B-cell malignancies (Syed et al. 2006). Induction of PLK3 transcription by TP53 (Jen and Cheung 2005) may be important for coordination of M phase events through PLK3-mediated nuclear accumulation of CDC25C (Bahassi et al. 2004). RGCC is induced by TP53 and implicated in cell cycle regulation, possibly through its association with PLK1 (Saigusa et al. 2007). PLAGL1 (ZAC1) is a zinc finger protein directly transcriptionally induced by TP53 (Rozenfeld-Granot et al. 2002). PLAGL1 expression is frequently lost in cancer (Varrault et al. 1998) and PLAGL1 has been implicated in both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Spengler et al. 1997), but its mechanism of action remains unknown."
TP53 stimulates SCO2 gene transcription,"TP53 (p53) directly stimulates transcription of the SCO2 gene. SCO2, synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase 2, is a copper-binding assembly protein for the mitochondrial COX (cytochrome C oxidase) complex which enables aerobic respiration. When SCO2 levels are reduced, as occurs in TP53 deficient cells, the glycolysis becomes the main energy source for the cell. The TP53-mediated regulation of SCO2 and other mitochondrial biogenesis genes provides a possible explanation for the Warburg effect (Warburg 1956) observed in some cancer cells (Matoba et al. 2006)."
TP53 Regulates Transcription of Cell Cycle Genes,"Under a variety of stress conditions, TP53 (p53), stabilized by stress-induced phosphorylation at least on S15 and S20 serine residues, can induce the transcription of genes involved in cell cycle arrest. Cell cycle arrest provides cells an opportunity to repair the damage before division, thus preventing the transmission of genetic errors to daughter cells. In addition, it allows cells to attempt a recovery from the damage and survive, preventing premature cell death.<p>TP53 controls transcription of genes involved in both G1 and G2 cell cycle arrest. The most prominent TP53 target involved in G1 arrest is the inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases CDKN1A (p21). CDKN1A is one of the earliest genes induced by TP53 (El-Deiry et al. 1993). CDKN1A binds and inactivates CDK2 in complex with cyclin A (CCNA) or E (CCNE), thus preventing G1/S transition (Harper et al. 1993). Nevertheless, under prolonged stress, the cell destiny may be diverted towards an apoptotic outcome. For instance, in case of an irreversible damage, TP53 can induce transcription of an RNA binding protein PCBP4, which can bind and destabilize CDKN1A mRNA, thus alleviating G1 arrest and directing the affected cell towards G2 arrest and, possibly, apoptosis (Zhu and Chen 2000, Scoumanne et al. 2011). Expression of E2F7 is directly induced by TP53. E2F7 contributes to G1 cell cycle arrest by repressing transcription of E2F1, a transcription factor that promotes expression of many genes needed for G1/S transition (Aksoy et al. 2012, Carvajal et al. 2012). ARID3A is a direct transcriptional target of TP53 (Ma et al. 2003) that may promote G1 arrest by cooperating with TP53 in induction of CDKN1A transcription (Lestari et al. 2012). However, ARID3A may also promote G1/S transition by stimulating transcriptional activity of E2F1 (Suzuki et al. 1998, Peeper et al. 2002).<p>TP53 contributes to the establishment of G2 arrest by inducing transcription of GADD45A and SFN, and by inhibiting transcription of CDC25C. TP53 induces GADD45A transcription in cooperation with chromatin modifying enzymes EP300, PRMT1 and CARM1 (An et al. 2004). GADD45A binds Aurora kinase A (AURKA), inhibiting its catalytic activity and preventing AURKA-mediated G2/M transition (Shao et al. 2006, Sanchez et al. 2010). GADD45A also forms a complex with PCNA. PCNA is involved in both normal and repair DNA synthesis. The effect of GADD45 interaction with PCNA, if any, on S phase progression, G2 arrest and DNA repair is not known (Smith et al. 1994, Hall et al. 1995, Sanchez et al. 2010, Kim et al. 2013). SFN (14-3-3-sigma) is induced by TP53 (Hermeking et al. 1997) and contributes to G2 arrest by binding to the complex of CDK1 and CCNB1 (cyclin B1) and preventing its translocation to the nucleus. Phosphorylation of a number of nuclear proteins by the complex of CDK1 and CCNB1 is needed for G2/M transition (Chan et al. 1999). While promoting G2 arrest, SFN can simultaneously inhibit apoptosis by binding to BAX and preventing its translocation to mitochondria, a step involved in cytochrome C release (Samuel et al. 2001). TP53 binds the promoter of the CDC25C gene in cooperation with the transcriptional repressor E2F4 and represses CDC25C transcription, thus maintaining G2 arrest (St Clair et al. 2004, Benson et al. 2014).<p>Several direct transcriptional targets of TP53 are involved in cell cycle arrest but their mechanism of action is still unknown. BTG2 is induced by TP53, leading to cessation of cellular proliferation (Rouault et al. 1996, Duriez et al. 2002). BTG2 binds to the CCR4-NOT complex and promotes mRNA deadenylation activity of this complex. Interaction between BTG2 and CCR4-NOT is needed for the antiproliferative activity of BTG2, but the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated (Rouault et al. 1998, Mauxion et al. 2008, Horiuchi et al. 2009, Doidge et al. 2012, Ezzeddine et al. 2012). Two polo-like kinases, PLK2 and PLK3, are direct transcriptional targets of TP53. TP53-mediated induction of PLK2 may be important for prevention of mitotic catastrophe after spindle damage (Burns et al. 2003). PLK2 is involved in the regulation of centrosome duplication through phosphorylation of centrosome-related proteins CENPJ (Chang et al. 2010) and NPM1 (Krause and Hoffmann 2010). PLK2 is frequently transcriptionally silenced through promoter methylation in B-cell malignancies (Syed et al. 2006). Induction of PLK3 transcription by TP53 (Jen and Cheung 2005) may be important for coordination of M phase events through PLK3-mediated nuclear accumulation of CDC25C (Bahassi et al. 2004). RGCC is induced by TP53 and implicated in cell cycle regulation, possibly through its association with PLK1 (Saigusa et al. 2007). PLAGL1 (ZAC1) is a zinc finger protein directly transcriptionally induced by TP53 (Rozenfeld-Granot et al. 2002). PLAGL1 expression is frequently lost in cancer (Varrault et al. 1998) and PLAGL1 has been implicated in both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Spengler et al. 1997), but its mechanism of action remains unknown.<p>The zinc finger transcription factor ZNF385A (HZF) is a direct transcriptional target of TP53 that can form a complex with TP53 and facilitate TP53-mediated induction of CDKN1A and SFN (14-3-3 sigma) transcription (Das et al. 2007).<p>For a review of the role of TP53 in cell cycle arrest and cell cycle transcriptional targets of TP53, please refer to Riley et al. 2008, Murray-Zmijewski et al. 2008, Bieging et al. 2014, Kruiswijk et al. 2015."
TP53 Regulates Metabolic Genes,"While the p53 tumor suppressor protein (TP53) is known to inhibit cell growth by inducing apoptosis, senescence and cell cycle arrest, recent studies have found that p53 is also able to influence cell metabolism to prevent tumor development. TP53 regulates transcription of many genes involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, nucleotides and amino acids, protein synthesis and aerobic respiration.<p>TP53 stimulates transcription of TIGAR, a D-fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase. TIGAR activity decreases glycolytic rate and lowers ROS (reactive oxygen species) levels in cells (Bensaad et al. 2006). TP53 may also negatively regulate the rate of glycolysis by inhibiting the expression of glucose transporters GLUT1, GLUT3 and GLUT4 (Kondoh et al. 2005, Schwartzenberg-Bar-Yoseph et al. 2004, Kawauchi et al. 2008).<p>TP53 negatively regulates several key points in PI3K/AKT signaling and downstream mTOR signaling, decreasing the rate of protein synthesis and, hence, cellular growth. TP53 directly stimulates transcription of the tumor suppressor PTEN, which acts to inhibit PI3K-mediated activation of AKT (Stambolic et al. 2001). TP53 stimulates transcription of sestrin genes, SESN1, SESN2, and SESN3 (Velasco-Miguel et al. 1999, Budanov et al. 2002, Brynczka et al. 2007). One of sestrin functions may be to reduce and reactivate overoxidized peroxiredoxin PRDX1, thereby reducing ROS levels (Budanov et al. 2004, Papadia et al. 2008, Essler et al. 2009). Another function of sestrins is to bind the activated AMPK complex and protect it from AKT-mediated inactivation. By enhancing AMPK activity, sestrins negatively regulate mTOR signaling (Budanov and Karin 2008, Cam et al. 2014). The expression of DDIT4 (REDD1), another negative regulator of mTOR signaling, is directly stimulated by TP63 and TP53. DDIT4 prevents AKT-mediated inactivation of TSC1:TSC2 complex, thus inhibiting mTOR cascade (Cam et al. 2014, Ellisen et al. 2002, DeYoung et al. 2008). TP53 may also be involved, directly or indirectly, in regulation of expression of other participants of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, such as PIK3CA (Singh et al. 2002), TSC2 and AMPKB (Feng et al. 2007). <p>TP53 regulates mitochondrial metabolism through several routes. TP53 stimulates transcription of SCO2 gene, which encodes a mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase assembly protein (Matoba et al. 2006). TP53 stimulates transcription of RRM2B gene, which encodes a subunit of the ribonucleotide reductase complex, responsible for the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides and essential for the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA content in the cell (Tanaka et al. 2000, Bourdon et al. 2007, Kulawiec et al. 2009). TP53 also transactivates mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), a nuclear-encoded gene important for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transcription and maintenance (Park et al. 2009). Finally, TP53 stimulates transcription of the mitochondrial glutaminase GLS2, leading to increased mitochondrial respiration rate and reduced ROS levels (Hu et al. 2010). <p>The great majority of tumor cells generate energy through aerobic glycolysis, rather than the much more efficient aerobic mitochondrial respiration, and this metabolic change is known as the Warburg effect (Warburg 1956). Since the majority of tumor cells have impaired TP53 function, and TP53 regulates a number of genes involved in glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, it is likely that TP53 inactivation plays an important role in the metabolic derangement of cancer cells such as the Warburg effect and the concomitant increased tumorigenicity (reviewed by Feng and Levine 2010). On the other hand, some mutations of TP53 in Li-Fraumeni syndrome may result in the retention of its wild-type metabolic activities while losing cell cycle and apoptosis functions (Wang et al. 2013). Consistent with such human data, some mutations of p53, unlike p53 null state, retain the ability to regulate energy metabolism while being inactive in regulating its classic gene targets involved in cell cycle, apoptosis and senescence. Retention of metabolic and antioxidant functions of p53 protects p53 mutant mice from early onset tumorigenesis (Li et al. 2012). "
Defective TP53 does not tetramerize,"A number of nonsense and frameshift truncations result in mutant TP53 proteins that lack the tetramerization domain (TD). In addition, several missense mutations affect the tetramerization domain, some of which, like L344P, have been shown to impede tetramerization (Chène and Bechter 1999; Lubin et al. 2010).<br>The following TD missense mutations have been shown to impede the ability of TP53 to tetramerize:<br>TP53 L330H (Rollenhagen and Chène 1998: partially active when overexpressed; Atz et al. 2000; Kamada et al. 2011: partial loss of function)<br>TP53 L330P (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 L330R (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 G334V (Atz et al. 2000; Kamada et al. 2011: partial loss-of-function)<br>TP53 R337C (Davison et al. 1998, Lomax et al. 1998, Kamada et al. 2011: partial loss of function; Rollenhagen and Chène 1998: partially active when overexpressed; Atz et al. 2000)<br>TP53 R337H (Gordo et al. 2008; DiGiammarino et al. 2002: pH-dependent destabilization of the tetramerization domain; Kamada et al. 2011: able to tetramerize, but tetramers are unstable at physiological temperature)<br>TP53 R337L (Rollenhagen and Chène 1998: partially active when overexpressed; Kamada et al. 2011: able to tetramerize, but tetramers are unstable at physiological temperature)<br>TP53 R337P (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 F338I (Kamada et al. 2011: partial loss of function)<br>TP53 F341C (Kamada et al. 2011: partial loss of function)<br>TP53 R342P (Rollenhagen and Chène 1998; Chène and Bechter 1999, Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 L344P (Ishioka et al. 1997; Davison et al. 1998; Lomax et al. 1998; Rollenhagen and Chène 1998; Chène and Bechter 1999; Lubin et al. 2010; Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 L344R (Kamada et al. 2011: partial loss of function)<br>TP53 A347T (Kamada et al. 2011: partial loss of function)<br>TP53 L348S (Kamada et al. 2011: partial loss of function)<br>TP53 K351E (Ishioka et al. 1997)<br>The following TP53 TD missense mutants whose tetramerization ability has not been investigated are annotated as candidates because they resemble functionally characterized TP53 TD missense mutants with loss of tetramerization:<br>TP53 L330F (similar to TP53 L330H)<br>TP53 L330I (similar to TP53 L330H)<br>TP53 G334E (similar to TP53 G334V)<br>TP53 R337G (similar to TP53 R337C and TP53 R337L)<br>TP53 R337S (similar to TP53 R337C and TP53 R337L)<br>TP53 F341L (similar to TP53 F341C)<br>TP53 F341S (similar to TP53 F341C)<br>TP53 F341V (similar to TP53 F341C)<br>TP53 A347D (similar to TP53 A347T)<br>TP53 A347P (similar to TP53 A347T)<br>TP53 K351N (similar to TP53 K351E)<br>TP53 K351R (similar to TP53 K351E)<br><br>The TD missense mutant TP53 R342Q, which is similar to TP53 R342P, as well as the missense mutants TP53 E349D and TP53 Q354R, were not annotated because they were shown to be able to oligomerize with a recombinant wild type TP53 protein and activate transcription from the CDKN1A (p21) target promoter (Rollenhagen and Chène 1998) and to form homotetramers in vitro at a level similar to the wild type protein (Kamada et al. 2011). In addition, the following TD missense mutants of TP53 were found to tetramerize in vitro at a level not significantly different the wild type TP53, although the stability of some of the tetramers is reduced compared to the wild type tetramers; these mutants have not been annotated even if they share the sequence similarity with functionally impacted missense mutants:<br>TP53 E326G (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 Y327D (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 Y327H (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 Y327S (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 F328L (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 F328S (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 F328V (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 T329I (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 T329S (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 Q331H (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 Q331P (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 Q331R (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 I332V (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 G334W (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 R335G (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 R335H (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 R335L (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 F338L (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 E339K (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 E339Q (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 R342L (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 R342Q (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 E343G (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 E346A (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 A347G (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 L348F (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 D352H (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 A353T (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 Q354E (Kamada et al. 2011)<br>TP53 Q354K (Kamada et al. 2011)<br><br>Two nonsense mutants of TP53, TP53 K351* and TP53 Q354*, in which truncation occurs at the very end of the TD, were shown to retain, at least partially, the ability to form dimers and, in the case of TP53 Q354* tetramers, as well as to be able to inhibit colony formation to some extent (Ishioka et al. 1997). These two mutants have been annotated as candidates. Other TP53 truncation mutants annotated as candidates for the loss of tetramerization ability are nonsense and frameshift cancer mutants in which the stop codon occurs upstream of the TD or affects the first three amino acids of the TD. These mutants have not been functionally studied but resemble the synthetic mutant p153 (1-320) which consists of the first 320 amino acids and lacks the TD and the C-terminal domain (CTD). This mutant is unable to tetramerize, but can form stacked oligomers at the recombinant target gene promoter and induce transcription at a low level. Stacked oligomers are formed through interactions that involve amino acid residues outside the TD, which are facilitated by the presence of the target DNA sequence (Stenger et al. 1994). In some of the candidate truncation mutants the stop codon occurs close to the N-terminus, and these mutants are likely to represent null mutants."
Loss of Function of TP53 in Cancer,"TP53 is the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor gene, with mutations present in more than 50% of human tumors and germline mutation in TP53 being underlying cause of the cancer-predisposing Li-Fraumeni syndrome (reviewed in Monti et al. 2020). The TP53 gene maps to chromosomal band 17p13 and encodes a transcription factor that contains four functional domains. A transactivation domain (TAD) involves amino acid residues 1-61 and is involved in interaction with components of the transcription machinery. A DNA binding domain (DBD) involves amino acid residues 94-290 and interacts with specific DNA target sequences called p53 response elements. A C-terminal domain (CTD) involves residues 357-393 and regulates DNA binding (reviewed in Monti et al. 2020). A tetramerization domain (TD) involves amino acids 325-355 and is needed for the formation of TP53 homotetramers. TP53 is considered the “guardian of the genome” (Lane 1992) as it is activated by DNA damage to initiate, depending on the amount of damage, cell cycle arrest, senescence or apoptosis (reviewed in Reinhardt and Schumacher 2012). In addition, TP53 regulates the expression of DNA repair genes, and is involved in the regulation of metabolism and autophagy (reviewed in Monti et al. 2020).<br>Most cancer-derived TP53 mutations are missense mutations that affect the central DNA binding domain of TP53 (amino acid residues 94-312). Eight hotspot amino acid substitutions in this region (R175H, G245S, R248Q, R248W, R249S, R273H, R273S and R282W) are found in close to 30% of TP53-mutated cancers. Based on their functional impact, TP53 mutations can be classified as 1) loss-of-function (LOF), 2) partial LOF (which may involve temperature sensitivity); 3) wild type-like (WT-L) or super-transactivating (ST) mutants; 4) mutants with altered specificity (AS), which are active or partially active on some but inactive on other TP53 target genes; 5) dominant-negative (DN) mutants, able to tetramerize with and inhibit the activity of the wild type TP53 protein. Some of the TP53 mutants, especially in the category of ST and AS mutants, are gain-of-function (GOF) mutants, able to interact with novel target genes and/or novel components of the transcriptional machinery (reviewed in Monti et al. 2020, and Gencel-Augusto and Lozano 2020).<br>Due to the complex function of WT-L, ST, AS and DN mutants of TP53, we have so far focused on annotating LOF mutants of TP53 which are unable to oligomerize due to mutations in the TD. Although accounting for a small percent of TP53 mutants, TD mutant are therefore considered to be completely defective in transcriptional activity, with no possibility of AS, DN and GOF effects (Chène and Bechter 1999, reviewed in Chène 2001, and Kamada et al. 2016). However, when overexpressed, some missense TD mutants of TP53 can form homotetramers and heterotetramers with the wild type TP53 which are partially functional and some extent of AS, DN and GOF effects may not be excluded for those mutants (Atz et al. 2000, reviewed in Chène 2001). In addition, the synthetic mutant p153(1-320) which consists of the first 320 amino acids and lacks the TD and CTD, while unable to tetramerize, can form stacked oligomers at the recombinant target gene promoter and induce transcription at a low level. Stacked oligomers are formed through interactions that involve amino acid residues outside the TD, which are facilitated by the presence of a target DNA sequence (Stenger et al. 1994)."
