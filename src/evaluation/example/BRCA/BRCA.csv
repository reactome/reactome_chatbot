CCNK:CDK12 binds RNA Pol II at DNA repair genes,"The complex of CDK12 and CCNK (cyclin K) associates with the RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) elongation complex at DNA repair genes encoding long primary transcripts, such as BRCA1, ATR, FANCI, FANCD2, ATM, MDC1, CHEK1, RAD51D and APEX1 (Blazek et al. 2011, Bartkowiak and Greenleaf 2015, Ekumi et al. 2015, Liang et al. 2015)."
CDK12 stimulates expression of DNA repair genes,"CDK12-mediated phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) subunit POLR2A (Rpb1) positively regulates transcription and, hence, expression of a set of DNA repair genes that encode long primary transcripts. CDK12, in complex with the TP53-regulated CCNK (cyclin K), phosphorylates POLR2A that was pre-phosphorylated by the CDK9-containing complex P-TEFb. CDK12-mediated phosphorylation of POLR2A is thought to increase the processivity of the RNA Pol II, enabling efficient transcription of long DNA repair genes (Blazek et al. 2011, Cheng et al. 2012, Bosken et al. 2014, Bartkowiak and Greenleaf 2015). CDK12 was shown to colocalize with the RNA Pol II complex at FANCD2, FANCI, ATM, CHEK1, MDC1, RAD51D and ATR gene loci (Ekumi et al. 2015) and to be necessary for achieving sufficient BRCA1 expression (Blazek et al. 2011). CDK12 positively regulates the expression of APEX1, involved in base excision repair (Liang et al. 2015). Recurrent CDK12 mutations are found in ovarian cancer. These mutations affect either the catalytic cleft of CDK12 or disable the interaction of CDK12 with CCNK, resulting in the loss of CDK12 function. Ovarian tumors that harbour inactivating CDK12 mutations exhibit decreased BRCA1 levels, defective homologous recombination repair, increased sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, and sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Joshi et al. 2014, Ekumi et al. 2015).

TP53 Regulates Transcription of DNA Repair Genes,"Several DNA repair genes contain p53 response elements and their transcription is positively regulated by TP53 (p53). TP53-mediated regulation probably ensures increased protein level of DNA repair genes under genotoxic stress.<p>TP53 directly stimulates transcription of several genes involved in DNA mismatch repair, including MSH2 (Scherer et al. 2000, Warnick et al. 2001), PMS2 and MLH1 (Chen and Sadowski 2005). TP53 also directly stimulates transcription of DDB2, involved in nucleotide excision repair (Tan and Chu 2002), and FANCC, involved in the Fanconi anemia pathway that repairs DNA interstrand crosslinks (Liebetrau et al. 1997). Other p53 targets that can influence DNA repair functions are RRM2B (Kuo et al. 2012), XPC (Fitch et al. 2003), GADD45A (Amundson et al. 2002), CDKN1A (Cazzalini et al. 2010) and PCNA (Xu and Morris 1999). Interestingly, the responsiveness of some of these DNA repair genes to p53 activation has been shown in human cells but not for orthologous mouse genes (Jegga et al. 2008, Tan and Chu 2002). Contrary to the positive modulation of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and mismatch repair (MMR), p53 can negatively modulate base excision repair (BER), by down-regulating the endonuclease APEX1 (APE1), acting in concert with SP1 (Poletto et al. 2016).<p>Expression of several DNA repair genes is under indirect TP53 control, through TP53-mediated stimulation of cyclin K (CCNK) expression (Mori et al. 2002). CCNK is the activating cyclin for CDK12 and CDK13 (Blazek et al. 2013). The complex of CCNK and CDK12 binds and phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase II subunit POLR2A, which is necessary for efficient transcription of long DNA repair genes, including BRCA1, ATR, FANCD2, FANCI, ATM, MDC1, CHEK1 and RAD51D. Genes whose transcription is regulated by the complex of CCNK and CDK12 are mainly involved in the repair of DNA double strand breaks and/or the Fanconi anemia pathway (Blazek et al. 2011, Cheng et al. 2012, Bosken et al. 2014, Bartkowiak and Greenleaf 2015, Ekumi et al. 2015)."
SUMOylation of DNA damage response and repair proteins,"Several factors that participate in DNA damage response and repair are SUMOylated (reviewed in Dou et al. 2011, Bekker-Jensen and Mailand 2011, Ulrich 2012, Psakhye and Jentsch 2012, Bologna and Ferrari 2013, Flotho and Melchior 2013, Jackson and Durocher 2013). SUMOylation can alter enzymatic activity and protein stability or it can serve to recruit additional factors. For example, SUMOylation of Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) causes TDG to lose affinity for its product, an abasic site opposite a G residue, and thus increases turnover of the enzyme. During repair of double-strand breaks SUMO1, SUMO2, SUMO3, and the SUMO E3 ligases PIAS1 and PIAS4 accumulate at double-strand breaks where BRCA1, HERC1, RNF168, MDC1, and TP53BP1 are SUMOylated. SUMOylation of BRCA1 may increase its ubiquitin ligase activity while SUMOylation of MDC1 and HERC2 appears to play a role in recruitment of proteins such as RNF4 and RNF8 to double strand breaks. Similarly SUMOylation of RPA1 (RPA70) recruits RAD51 in the homologous recombination pathway."
