CDK5:p25 phosphorylates GOLGA2,"Golgi fragmentation is observed in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. The underlying mechanism, based on a mouse AD model, is the phosphorylation of the Golgi membrane protein GOLGA2 (GM130) by the CDK5:p25 complex. CDK5:p25 phosphorylates GOLGA2 (GM130) on a conserved residue S37, phosphorylated by CDK1 in mitotic prophase (Lowe et al. 1998), triggering Golgi apparatus disassembly in Alzheimer's disease (Sun et al. 2008). Please note that S37 of GOLGA2 is sometimes labeled as S25 in the literature because the recombinant Golga2 construct used in the original study of mitotic Golgi fragmentation (Lowe et al. 1998) lacked 12 N-terminal amino acids of Golga2."
CDK5:p25 phosphorylates PRDX1,"Oxidative stress, manifested through accumulation of reactive oxygen species in the cell, is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Based on mouse model studies, CDK5, aberrantly activated by binding to p25, phosphorylates the peroxide reductase PRDX1 on a conserved threonine residue T90, thus inactivating it and contributing to ROS accumulation (Sun et al. 2008)."
CDK5:p25 phosphorylates lamin B1,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), like many other neurodegenerative diseases, is characterized by nuclear envelope fragmentation. Based on a mouse AD model, nuclear fragmentation is initiated by phosphorylation of nuclear lamins by p25-activated CDK5. The CDK5:p25 complex phosphorylates lamin B1 (LMNB1) at serine residues S23 and S393. Nuclear envelope fragmentation increases access of the CDK5:p25 complex to nuclear proteins and precedes neuronal death (Chang et al. 2011)."
CDK5:p25 phosphorylates PRDX2,"Oxidative stress, manifested through accumulation of reactive oxygen species in the cell, is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Based on mouse model studies, CDK5, aberrantly activated by binding to p25, phosphorylates the peroxide reductase PRDX2 on a conserved threonine residue T89, thus inactivating it and contributing to ROS accumulation (Sun et al. 2008)."
CDK5:p25 phosphorylates JUN,"Based on mouse model studies, the JUN transcription factor undergoes biphasic activation in Alzheimer's disease. JUN is phosphorylated directly by p25-bound CDK5 at serine residues S63 and S73. CDK5:p25-mediated increase in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) triggers activation of JNK kinases (MAPK8, MAPK9, MAPK10), which phosphorylate JUN at S63 and S73 at a later time point (Sun et al. 2009).<p>Aberrant activation of CDK5 by p25 binding also triggers activation of MKK6 (MAP2K6), a p38 MAP kinase. Levels of phosphorylated MAP2K6 are increased in Alzheimer's disease. Activation of p38 MAP kinase(s) results in increased JUN expression (Chang et al. 2010)."
CDK5:p25 phosphorylates lamin A,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), like many other neurodegenerative diseases, is characterized by nuclear envelope fragmentation. Based on a mouse AD model, nuclear fragmentation is initiated by phosphorylation of nuclear lamins by p25-activated CDK5. The CDK5:p25 complex phosphorylates lamin A (LMNA-1) at serine residues S22 and S392, with S392 being the major CDK5 target site. Nuclear envelope fragmentation increases access of the CDK5:p25 complex to nuclear proteins and precedes neuronal death (Chang et al. 2011)."
Deregulated CDK5 triggers multiple neurodegenerative pathways in Alzheimer's disease models,"Post-mitotic neurons do not have an active cell cycle. However, deregulation of Cyclin Dependent Kinase-5 (CDK5) activity in these neurons can aberrantly activate various components of cell cycle leading to neuronal death (Chang et al. 2012). Random activation of cell cycle proteins has been shown to play a key role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders (Yang et al. 2003, Lopes et al. 2009). CDK5 is not activated by the canonical cyclins, but binds to its own specific partners, CDK5R1 and CDK5R2 (aka p35 and p39, respectively) (Tsai et al. 1994, Tang et al. 1995). Expression of p35 is nearly ubiquitous, whereas p39 is largely expressed in the central nervous system. A variety of neurotoxic insults such as beta-amyloid (A-beta), ischemia, excitotoxicity and oxidative stress disrupt the intracellular calcium homeostasis in neurons, thereby leading to the activation of calpain, which cleaves p35 into p25 and p10 (Lee et al. 2000). p25 has a six-fold longer half-life compared to p35 and lacks the membrane anchoring signal, which results in its constitutive activation and mislocalization of the CDK5:p25 complex to the cytoplasm and the nucleus. There, CDK5:p25 is able to access and phosphorylate a variety of atypical targets, triggering a cascade of neurotoxic pathways that culminate in neuronal death. One such neurotoxic pathway involves CDK5-mediated random activation of cell cycle proteins which culminate in neuronal death. Exposure of primary cortical neurons to oligomeric beta-amyloid (1-42) hyper-activates CDK5 due to p25 formation, which in turn phosphorylates CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C. CDK5 phosphorylates CDC25A at S40, S116 and S261; CDC25B at S50, T69, S160, S321 and S470; and CDC25C at T48, T67, S122, T130, S168 and S214. CDK5-mediated phosphorylation of CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C not only increases their phosphatase activities but also facilitates their release from 14-3-3 inhibitory binding. CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C in turn activate CDK1, CDK2 and CDK4 kinases causing neuronal death. Consistent with this mechanism, higher CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C activities were observed in human Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical samples, as compared to age-matched controls. Inhibition of CDC25 isoforms confers neuroprotection to beta-amyloid toxicity, which underscores the contribution of this pathway to AD pathogenesis"
